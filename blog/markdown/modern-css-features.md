# Modern CSS Features Every Developer Should Know in 2025

CSS has evolved dramatically in recent years, adding powerful features that were once only possible with JavaScript. Let's explore the most important CSS features you should be using in 2025

## Container Queries: Beyond Responsive Design

Container queries are revolutionizing how we think about responsive design. Unlike media queries that respond to viewport dimensions, container queries allow elements to adapt based on their parent container's size:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
  container-name: card;
}

@container card (width < 400px) {
  .card-title {
    font-size: 1rem;
  }
  
  .card-content {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

This approach enables truly modular components that adapt consistently regardless of where they're placed in your layout.

## The :has() Selector: Conditional Styling

The `:has()` selector provides "if this contains that" logic directly in CSS. This powerful parent selector opens up possibilities that were previously only possible with JavaScript:

```css
/* Style a form field differently when it contains an invalid input */
.form-field:has(input:invalid) {
  border-color: red;
}

/* Apply different styles to articles with images */
article:has(img) {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

## Custom Properties with Calculation Functions

CSS variables (custom properties) combined with calculation functions create dynamic design systems:

```css
:root {
  --base-size: 1rem;
  --scale-ratio: 1.25;
  --color-primary: hsl(220, 80%, 50%);
}

h1 {
  font-size: calc(var(--base-size) * var(--scale-ratio) * var(--scale-ratio));
  /* Computed as: 1rem × 1.25 × 1.25 = 1.5625rem */
  
  /* Color transformations */
  background-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 80%, white);
  color: color-contrast(var(--color-primary) vs white, black);
}
```

## Scroll-Driven Animations

Control animations based on scroll progress without JavaScript:

```css
@keyframes fade-in {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}

.reveal {
  animation: fade-in linear;
  animation-timeline: scroll(root block);
  animation-range: entry 30% cover 50%;
}
```

This declaration triggers the animation when the element enters the viewport and completes when it's 50% in view.

## Subgrid: True Grid Alignment

Subgrid allows nested grid elements to align to the parent grid:

```css
.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

.nested-grid {
  grid-column: 2 / 12;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```

This feature solves complex alignment problems that were previously difficult to achieve.

## Style Queries: Beyond Layout

Style queries let you respond to computed styles rather than just dimensions:

```css
.theme-container {
  container-name: theme;
  container-type: style;
}

@container theme style(--theme: dark) {
  .card {
    background-color: #222;
    color: #fff;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

These CSS features represent a major shift in frontend development capabilities. By leveraging them effectively, you can create more maintainable codebases with less reliance on JavaScript for presentational concerns.

In future posts, I'll explore how these features can be combined for powerful design systems and component libraries.
