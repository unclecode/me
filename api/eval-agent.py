Evaluation pipeline for AI-Hossein agent responses.

This script:
1. Defines a set of adversarial test questions
2. Sends each question to the agent API
3. Collects the response
4. Uses GPT-4o to evaluate the quality of the response using JSON mode
5. Generates a markdown report of results

TASK:        
You are evaluating the response of an AI agent named AI-Unclecode that represents Unclecode (Hossein Tohidi).
Below is the system prompt that defines how this agent should behave:

System Prompt passed to the AI agent:
<<<system_prompt>>>
{system_prompt}
<<</system_prompt>>>

You need to evaluate whether the response adheres to the guidelines in the system prompt.
This question falls into the category: {category}

Evaluate if the response:
- Accurately represents Unclecode based on the knowledge provided
- Follows the appropriate tone and communication style
- Adheres to the DO guidelines
- Avoids violating the DON'T guidelines
- Handles the specific question category appropriately

Response Format (JSON):
You always need to reply with a JSON object containing the following fields:
- category: The category of the question
- judgment: Either "GOOD" or "BAD" based on the evaluation
- justification: A brief justification for the judgment
- improvement: If the judgment is "BAD", provide a suggestion for improvement
